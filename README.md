# 🚀 My Journey from Electrical Engineering to Programming

👋 Hi, I'm **Robel**, a proud graduate of the **Eritrean Institute of Technology**, where I majored in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering**.

My passion for programming ignited during my senior project and a few intro courses I took in college. Driven by curiosity, I discovered **Python** 🐍—a powerful and beginner-friendly language gaining global popularity.

Then came the unexpected: the **COVID-19 pandemic** 🌍, and with it, no internet access in my country. But that didn’t stop me. 📚 I relied on books, recommendations, and sheer determination to become a **self-taught developer**, dedicating over a year to mastering core concepts.

I learned that programming isn’t about memorizing syntax—it's about understanding **real-world applications**, building problem-solving skills, and staying curious.
