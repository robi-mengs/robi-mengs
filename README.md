# 🚀 From Electrical Engineering to Software — A Self-Made Developer

Hi, I’m **Robel** — an **Electrical and Electronics Engineering** graduate from the **Eritrean Institute of Technology**, now a dedicated **software developer** with a strong foundation in problem-solving and real-world application of code.

For my senior project, I designed and built a **computer-controlled underwater vehicle**, using **Python** to handle sensor integration, motor control, and data logging. That hands-on experience opened my eyes to the power of programming — and I’ve been hooked ever since.
