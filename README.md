# 🚀 My Journey: From Electrical Engineering to Programming

Hi, I'm **Robel**, an **Electrical & Electronics Engineering** graduate from the **Eritrean Institute of Technology**.  
My passion for programming ignited during my senior project and early courses. Choosing to learn **Python**—a top in-demand language—I faced a unique challenge: **no internet access** during the COVID-19 pandemic in my country.

Determined, I became **100% self-taught** using books and recommendations, dedicating a full year to mastering Python from scratch. This journey taught me programming is about **understanding foundations and real-world use**, not just memorizing code.
