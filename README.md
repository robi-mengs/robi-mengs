# 💡 From Electrical Engineering to Software Development — My Journey

Hello! I'm **Robel**, a graduate of the **Eritrean Institute of Technology** with a background in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering** — and a deep passion for solving problems through **code**.

While working on my senior project, I discovered programming and never looked back. I began with **Python** 🐍—drawn to its simplicity, real-world utility, and industry demand.

### 🌍 Overcoming Challenges, Building Resilience

When the **COVID-19 pandemic** hit, I found myself with **zero internet access**. Still determined to learn, I became fully **self-taught**, relying solely on books, offline resources, and community recommendations. 

This year-long journey sharpened more than just my technical skills—it shaped my mindset:

✅ Self-motivated  
✅ Adaptable under pressure  
✅ Persistent in the face of constraints
