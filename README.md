👋 Hello! I'm **Robel**, a proud graduate of the **Eritrean Institute of Technology**, where I majored in **Electrical and Electronics Engineering**. My passion for programming ignited during my academic journey—especially while working on my senior project, which heavily involved code. I also took a few introductory courses that further sparked my curiosity.

## 🔍 Why Python?

After doing some research, I discovered that **Python** was one of the most accessible and in-demand programming languages out there. Its clean syntax and growing popularity convinced me to dive in and start learning it from scratch.

But... my journey wasn’t easy.

## 🌍 The Pandemic & Offline Learning

When the **COVID-19 pandemic** hit, things got even tougher. In my country, we lost internet access—an unimaginable challenge for any aspiring programmer. But I didn’t give up.

📚 Instead of YouTube or online courses, I turned to **books**. I asked others for good references and went **fully self-taught**, dedicating an entire year to mastering Python—without formal instruction or an internet connection.

## 💡 What I Learned

Along the way, I learned something profound:

> 🧠 Programming isn’t just about memorizing code—  
> it’s about **understanding the foundations** and applying them to the real world.

This mindset helped me stay motivated. Despite transitioning from **Electrical Engineering** to programming, I found pride and confidence through persistence and self-belief.
